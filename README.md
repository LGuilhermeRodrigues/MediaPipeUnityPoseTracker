# MediaPipe Unity Plugin Pose Tracker

This repo. was used to change the build settings of the MediaPipeUnityPlugin and create a smaller asset bundle, with only the pose tracker model.

This is not needed anymore because this feature was implemented in the main [plugin](https://github.com/homuler/MediaPipeUnityPlugin/wiki/Installation-Guide#build-command)

There, you can specify the required solutions (e.g. python build.py build --desktop gpu --solutions face_mesh hands pose -vv)
